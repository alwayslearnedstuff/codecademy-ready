  <title>Notes from Day 1: Intro to HTML</title>
</head>
  <body>
    <!-- look to build the lessons in React or Vue with one-line style -->
    <h5>Note to reader:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>My goal is to combine code and explanations on one line, e.g.:
        <ul><li>Code: explanation</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>I use a deprecated tag (which shouldn't be used...but which all browsers still recognize) called:</li>
        <ul><li><xmp><xmp>: which displays raw text    ...and spaces...   and HTML tags like: <p></p><br/><li></li> etc. When you type those tags in an HTML doc, they are not displayed on the screen. </xmp></li></ul> 
    <li>Experienced web devs display HTML tags in the browser (like on Codecademy lessons) with CSS...but that's past my skillset at this point.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Day 1: Intro to HTML</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h5 style="display:inline">Element Structure:</h5><xmp style="display:inline"><opening_tag> Element content - text or link </closing_tag (if there is one: <br><hr><img> don't have closing tags)></xmp></li>
        <li>Basic html page structure:
        <li style="list-style: none;">
          <xmp>
            <!DOCTYPE html> <== Current standard is HTML 5. DOCTYPE tells browser what to expect. As HTML standards change, this ensures futureproofing.
            <html>
            <head> <== contains metadata not displayed in browser; more below
              <title></title> <== Title appears in browser tab
            </head>
            <body>
              <p>This is where the meat and potatoes lives</p> <== <p> is paragraph tag
            </body>
            </html>
          </xmp>    
        </li>
      </li>
      <li>HTML docs are collection of parent-child relationships</li>  
      <li style="list-style: none;">
          <xmp>
          <body> <== parent
            <p>Paragraph</p> <== child
          </body>
          </xmp>
      </li>
      <li>
        <xmp>
          Another example: 
          <body> <== parent
            <div> <== child
              <h1>Student</h1> <== grandchild of <body>; child of <div>; sibling of next element
              <p>Get Started</p> <== grandchild of <body>; child of <div>; sibling of prior element
            </div>
          </body>
        </xmp>
      </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Day 2: Common Elements/HTML Tags </h3>
    <h5>Here's the way the practice example page below looks when built; code below it:</h5>
      <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
              <div id="introduction">
                <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
                <p>The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently <strong>Least Concern</strong>.<br /><br /> There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</p>
                <h3>Species</h3>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.</p>

        <div> <== divides HTML docs into sections and can contain text, images, links, etc.
        <span> <== used to wrap small pieces of text within a sentence
        <em> <== generally renders as italics

      <h3>Day 4, Project 1: Travel Blog</h3>
      <h5>Here are the steps:</h5>
      <xmp>
        
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
1.
In your file manager, make a new folder inside of your development directory called Paris. Inside of that folder, create a new HTML file called index.html. Open index.html in your text editor.
2.
In index.html, add the basic code for a website to be structured properly (also called boilerplate code).

3.
Title your website: My Travel Blog

4.
Directly below the opening <body> tag of your index.html file, add an <h1> that says My Travels. Below that, add an <h2> that says Paris. Below that, add an <h3> that says September 2016.
5.
Below the <h3> element that says September 2016, add opening and closing <nav> tags. Do not add any content between them right now.
6.
Below the <nav> element you just created, create 3 new sections using the <div> tag. Give them the following ids, respectively:

highlights
story
contact
Remember, <div>s structure your content, and the ids can be used to link within a page.
Stuck? Get a hint
7.
Nest an <h3> inside the highlights <div>. The heading should say: My Favorite Spots in Paris.
8.
Nest an <h2> inside the story <div>. The heading should say:

A Weekend on the Seine.
9.
Below that, add three <h4>s that say Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3.

Give each opening tag an id that we will later use for same-page navigation. The first <h4> should have an id with a value of day1 and the other two should have ids that follow the same pattern.
10.
Nest an <h4> inside of the contact <div>. The heading should say:

If you have any questions about my blog, here is my contact information:

12.
Now you are going to construct the navigation bar for your page. Inside of the <nav> tag under the heading that says September 2016, nest an unordered list with these 3 list items:

Highlights
Full Story
Contact

Make each list item a same-page link to its respective section, using the <a> tag.

13.
Under Full Story, add an ordered list with these 3 list items:

Day 1
Day 2
Day 3
Make each list item a link to its respective day on the blog, using the <a> tag.

Now you're going to add information about your trip to Paris! Below the heading that says My Favorite Spots in Paris, create an unordered list with the following list items:

The Eiffel Tower
The Louvre
Jardin du Luxembourg
Palais Garnier
16.
Below the list, add a paragraph with the following text:

Click here to learn more about Paris!
Turn here into a link that goes to:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris
Add the target attribute with the appropriate value to your link so that the article opens in a new page or tab.
Stuck? Get a hint
17.
Directly below the heading A Weekend on the Seine, add a paragraph with this text:

I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!
18.
Below Day 1, add a paragraph with the following text:

On our first day, we started by visiting Montmartre right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking la Seine.
Emphasize the following French words:

Montmartre
la Seine

19.
Below Day 2, add a paragraph with this text:

On our second day, we went shopping on Avenue des Champs Elysees. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.

After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to Notre Dame. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited le Louvre.
Emphasize the following French words:

Avenue des Champs Elysees
Notre Dame
le Louvre

20.
Below `Day 3', add a paragraph with the following text:

The picture below is of me visiting the Arc de Triomphe. It's huge! We also went to le Musee D'Orsay. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.
Emphasize the following French words:

Arc de Triomphe
le Musee D'Orsay

      <h3>Day 5: Two Sandals and a Soup project</h3>
      <h5>Project instructions:</h5>
      <p>
        
In this project, you will recreate a web page that contains the restaurant's menu. The solution is provided to the right. You must use your knowledge of HTML and the website to the right to recreate it on your own computer.

In addition to the visual content in this image, the website must also contain:

Two HTML files in a project folder: index.html and home.html. Note: we do not provide any instructions for what you should add to home.html. The purpose of this file is to practice linking to an HTML document in a shared folder.
Links from Home and Menu to the files home.html and index.html, respectively.
Links from Soups, Salads and Desserts in the unordered list to their section on the menu.
The three images displayed on the web page (see image links below).
Image links:

Copy and paste the URL for this tomato soup picture
Copy and paste the URL for this caesar salad picture
Copy and paste the URL for this chocolate chip cookie picture
Use the website to the right and the resources above to guide you through the project.
      </p>
      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use "/" for the <em>href</em> for the page you're on. E.g. <xmp style="display:inline"><a href="/">Home</a> </xmp>the nav item on home.html</li>
        
      </ul>
  </body>
</html>

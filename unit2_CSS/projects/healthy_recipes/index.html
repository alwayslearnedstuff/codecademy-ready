7.
Finally, lets make the font Helvetica instead of the default Times New Roman. Instead of writing multiple selectors to apply the font-family property, write a selector that applies a font-family attribute to all text at once.

The selector should target the h1, h2, p, and li elements.

To change their font, include this line of code inside the curly braces:

font-family: Helvetica;
